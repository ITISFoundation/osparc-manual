# Welcome

Welcome to the osparc Documentation. This user manual aims to provide detailed information and background about how to use the osparc modeling and simulation platform.


The SIM-CORE, named **o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC**  (or ``osparc`` in short) – **O**pen **O**nline **S**imulations for **S**timulating **P**eripheral **A**ctivity to **R**elieve **C**onditions – is one of the three integrative cores of the SPARC program’s Data Resource Center (DRC). The aim of osparc is to establish a comprehensive, freely accessible, intuitive, and interactive online platform for simulating peripheral nerve system neuromodulation/ stimulation and its impact on organ physiology in a precise and predictive manner. To achieve this, the platform will comprise both state-of-the art and highly detailed animal and human anatomical models with realistic tissue property distributions that make it possible to perform simulations ranging from the molecular scale up to the complexity of the human body.
