# UC Davis

The multi-scale cardiac electrophysiology services from UC Davis provide a computational workflow for the integration and implementation of a reusable and reproducible cardiac multi-scale electrophysiology model. The workflow integrates multistep single-cell, 1D and 2D model simulations in a single automated process. The model formulation for ventricular cells from rabbit Soltis-Saucerman (1), and human Grandi-Bers (2) are implemented in the workflow.  Both models contain beta-adrenergic signaling pathways, and the firing rate model (unpublished Lewis model).

To explore the service and the model, please proceed as follows:

1. To use either the human or rabbit model templates, double click on the template which will prompt you to instantiate and name your own study. After this, the study flowchart should be displayed for you.

2. For a sample data set, select the file ____ (for human) or ___ (for rabbit) into the File Picker by double clicking the File Picker, navigating through the directory tree as shown: xxx

3. Next, click “Retrieve” at the bottom of the worbench and then “Run.” You will then be able to view results of the simulation in any of the viewer services.
