# 3D Results Viewer

This service gives a three-dimensional representation of the effects of a stimulating electrode around a bundle of nerve fibers.

The model includes the geometry of a pair of electrode contacts in gray, a bundle of nerve fibers in black and the log-scaled electric field lines induced by the two contacts of the electrodes and a 2D slice showing the electric field with a color gradient. 

### Usage
1. Upon clicking the play button (triangle) on the upper right hand side of the window, a simulation of the transmembrane voltage induced in the nerve bundle by the stimulating electrodes will start.
2. You will be able to see how that voltage propagates along the length of the nerve bundle as shown below.
3. To end the simulation, click the stop button (square) on the upper right hand side of the window.

4. You may rotate and scale the image, but due to the high complexity of this model, the 3D rendering may not execute completely and the image disappears. If this happens, a resizing of the window will bring the image back.
