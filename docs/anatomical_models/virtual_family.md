# Virtual Population

The Virtual Population (ViP) models are a set of detailed high-resolution anatomical models created by the [IT'IS Foundation](https://itis.swiss/news-events/news/latest-news/) from magnetic resonance image data of volunteers. Since their inception, the ViP models have become the gold standard for *in silico* biophysical modeling applications (now used by over 1000 groups world-wide and employed for >200 regulatory submissions) - for biophysical and biomedical modelling and simulation, including medical implant safety assessments.

The ViP3.x/4.x models are validated and the compatibility between versions has been assessed for EM simulations, i.e., the results of MR safety and MR implant safety evaluations are statistically identical for, e.g., the ViP3.x and 1.x models.

The V3.x models include more than 120 anatomical features and more than 300 tissues all together. The exhaustive list of tissues currently included is available for download. The recently released V4.0 models have more than  separate 1000 tissue regions, including about 240 peripheral nerve structures.

The CAD format of the organs allows meshing at arbitrary resolution without loss of detail and small features due to repeated sampling.

The first neuro-functionalized anatomical model from our [newest generation of ViP V4.0 models](/docs/anatomical_models/neurocouple.md) are Yoon-sun V4.0 and Jeduk V4.0. They have been designed to support novel neuro-stimulation investigations, e.g. MRI gradient safety and optimization of therapeutic devices.

The Virtual Population models V1.x and V3.x are fully compatible with the Poser tool available in the simulation platform Sim4Life. This tool allows postures to be modified for simulating various exposure configurations.

*The Poser Tool can be used to bring any of the models into a realistic in-use posture.*

Outlining these capabilities, the integration of anatomical and functionalized virtual human and animal models within o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC is heavily increasing the modeling and simulation functionalities of the SPARC Data and Resource Center (DRC) and thus to the SPARC program in general.
