# NeuroCouple

One of the core elements of the platform is a set of newly generated neuro- and physiology-functionalized human and animal anatomical models (called NEUROCOUPLE and NEUROFAUNA, respectively). The models will allow simulation of in vivo fields generated by implanted or external stimulators, elucidation of the resulting neuromodulations, and assessment of the changes induced in organ physiology.

The NEUROCOUPLE models (Yoon-sun and Jeduk) were created in a Swiss-Korean collaborative project called NEUROMAN between ITâ€™IS and the [Visible Korean](http://vkh3.kisti.re.kr/?q=node/24) team. The goal of the project was to create computational anatomical phantoms to study low frequency exposure safety. The ultimate vision and strength of these models lies in the detailed tissue (from the cranium and spinal cord to internal organs and major muscles) and peripheral nerve segmentations, which was enabled by the unique cryosection color image data.

The Computable Virtual Population V4.0 and V3.x (cViP) models are high-end high-resolution posable whole-body models for biophysical and biomedical modelling and simulation, including medical implant safety assessments.

These models include more than 1000 tissue regions, including about 240 peripheral nerve structures.

The CAD format of the organs allows meshing at arbitrary resolution without loss of detail and small features due to repeated sampling.

All the values of our comprehensive and up-to-date database of tissue properties can be applied to the cViP models.
