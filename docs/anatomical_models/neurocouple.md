# NeuroCouple

One of the core elements of the platform is a set of novel neuro- and physiology-functionalized human and animal anatomical models (called NEUROCOUPLE and NEUROFAUNA, respectively). The models will allow simulation of in vivo fields generated by implanted or external stimulators, elucidation of the resulting neuromodulations, and assessment of the changes induced in organ physiology.

The Computable Virtual Population V4.0 and V3.x (cViP) models are high-end high-resolution posable whole-body models for biophysical and biomedical modelling and simulation, including medical implant safety assessments.

These V3.x models include more than 120 anatomical features and more than 300 tissues all together. The exhaustive list of tissues currently included is available for download. The recently released V4.0 model has more than  separate 1000 tissue regions, including about 240 peripheral nerve structures.

The CAD format of the organs allows meshing at arbitrary resolution without loss of detail and small features due to repeated sampling.

All the values of our comprehensive and up-to-date database of tissue properties can be applied to the cViP models.
