# Anatomical Models

# Virtual Population

The Virtual Population (ViP) models are a set of detailed high-resolution anatomical models created by the [IT'IS Foundation](https://itis.swiss/news-events/news/latest-news/) from magnetic resonance image data of volunteers. Since their inception, the ViP models have become the gold standard for *in silico* biophysical modeling applications (now used by over 1000 groups world-wide and employed for >200 regulatory submissions) - for biophysical and biomedical modelling and simulation, including medical implant safety assessments.

The ViP3.x/4.x models are validated and the compatibility between versions has been assessed for EM simulations, i.e., the results of MR safety and MR implant safety evaluations are statistically identical for, e.g., the ViP3.x and 1.x models.

The V3.x models include more than 120 anatomical features and more than 300 tissues all together. The exhaustive list of tissues currently included is available for download. The recently released V4.0 models have more than  separate 1000 tissue regions, including about 240 peripheral nerve structures.

The CAD format of the organs allows meshing at arbitrary resolution without loss of detail and small features due to repeated sampling.

The first neuro-functionalized anatomical model from our [newest generation of ViP V4.0 models](/docs/anatomical_models/neurocouple.md) are Yoon-sun V4.0 and Jeduk V4.0. They have been designed to support novel neuro-stimulation investigations, e.g. MRI gradient safety and optimization of therapeutic devices.

The Virtual Population models V1.x and V3.x are fully compatible with the Poser tool available in the simulation platform Sim4Life. This tool allows postures to be modified for simulating various exposure configurations.

The NEUROCOUPLE models available for o2S2PARC represent the next generation of ViP models. They serve as physical environment for the modelling of neuromodulation devices (e.g., electromagnetic simulations of electroceuticals), but also as integration center for SPARC computational models and data.

# NeuroCouple

One of the core elements of the platform is a set of newly generated neuro- and physiology-functionalized human and animal anatomical models (called NEUROCOUPLE and NEUROFAUNA, respectively). The models will allow simulation of in vivo fields generated by implanted or external stimulators, elucidation of the resulting neuromodulations, and assessment of the changes induced in organ physiology.

The NEUROCOUPLE models (Yoon-sun and Jeduk) were created in a Swiss-Korean collaborative project called NEUROMAN between ITâ€™IS and the [Visible Korean](http://vkh3.kisti.re.kr/?q=node/24) team. The goal of the project was to create computational anatomical phantoms to study low frequency exposure safety. The ultimate vision and strength of these models lies in the detailed tissue (from the cranium and spinal cord to internal organs and major muscles) and peripheral nerve segmentations, which was enabled by the unique cryosection color image data.

The Computable Virtual Population V4.0 and V3.x (cViP) models are high-end high-resolution posable whole-body models for biophysical and biomedical modelling and simulation, including medical implant safety assessments.

These models include more than 1000 tissue regions, including about 240 peripheral nerve structures.

The CAD format of the organs allows meshing at arbitrary resolution without loss of detail and small features due to repeated sampling.

All the values of our comprehensive and up-to-date database of tissue properties can be applied to the cViP models.
