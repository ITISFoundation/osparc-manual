## Study From Template

You may also create the Study from an existing Template, navigate to the **Discover** tab of the **Dashboard** and click on an existing card under the **Templates** section. This will create a copy of the Template Study which will from this point on, be accessible from the **Studies** tab of the **Dashboard**. This Study will be private unless you decide to share it an any changes you make to the resulting Study will not affect the Template you have copied from.
