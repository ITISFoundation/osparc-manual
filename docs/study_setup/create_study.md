# Create a Study

## Study From Scratch
You may choose to create a Study (*o²S²PARC* project) from scratch or based on an existing Template. To create an empty Study with no Services inside, navigate to the the **Studies** tab of the **Dashboard** and click on the ```Empty Study``` button, which will take you directly to the **Study Workspace** of your new Study.

## Study From Template

You may also create the Study from an existing Template, navigate to the **Templates** tab of the **Dashboard** and click on an existing card. This will create a copy of the Template Study which will from this point on, be accessible from the **Studies** tab of the **Dashboard**. This Study will be private unless you decide to share it an any changes you make to the resulting Study will not affect the Template you have copied from.
