# Create a Study

You may choose to create a study (*osparc* project) from scratch or based on an existing template. To create an empty study with no services inside, navigate to the the **Studies** tab of the **Dashboard** and click on the ```Empty Study``` button, which will take you directly to the **Study Workspace** of your new study.

To create the study from an existing template, navigate to the **Discover** tab of the **Dashboard** and click on an existing card under the **Templates** section. This will create a copy of the template study which will from this point on, be accessible from the **Studies** tab of the **Dashboard**. This study will be private unless you decide to share it an any changes you make to the resulting study will not affect the template you have copied from. 

# Add a Service

Studies are composed of one or more services. To create another service inside of an existing study, you can double-click in the empty space of the workspace which will bring up the Service Catalog. Here you can filter, search and select a service to add to your study
