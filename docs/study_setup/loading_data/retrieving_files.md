# Retrieving Files

Some Services will provide you with output files. To access these files, double click on the Service which supplies output. This will now show Service settings. In the upper menu bar, towards the right side, you will see a ```Output Files``` button. You may also access output files by clicking on the file links in the "Outputs" section of the Service GUI. Clicking on that a file link will either download it to your local computer or, in specific cases (such as for PDF files), will open a new browser tab where you can preview the file.

When the ```Output Files``` button is clicked, a popup will show the files folder for this Service. You may then download these files locally by clicking the ```Download``` button with the cloud icon in the lower left hand corner.

## Other Files

Certain interactive Services will also be able to generate output files within the context of their own file systems. These Services will all provide the ability to download the files locally. For example, the 2D plot Service uses the RAW Graphs framework which allows you to download plotted data in multiple formats or HTML embedding.

You can always access all of your data in the Dashboard under the [Data Tab](/docs/platform_introduction/Data.md).
