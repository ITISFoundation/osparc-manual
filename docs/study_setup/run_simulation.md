# Running a Pipeline

For your custom models and basic computations, running a Study is straightforward. Once you have your pipeline connected, click the __Run__ button on the bottom right hand side of the screen. Please note that this will not run code that is written inside JupyterLab Services. Running a pipeline will execute only "computational" Services (e.g. Services where parameters are set before running such as the [Cardiac Tissue Models](docs/tutorials/uc_davis.md)).

*The* ```Run``` *Button is located at the top right corner of your **Study Workbench**, highlighted with purple in this image.*

To see run progress, you may expand the Logger subwindow of the **Study Workbench** on the lower left hand corner of the Study workspace where you will see messages about the status of the run.
