# Help & Support

Getting started with modeling and simulation can be a challenging task. We will try our best to guide you along the way. In case our user manual and the tutorial examples could not answer your question, take a look at the following resources:

**FAQ**

Encountered problems with the platform? Check out the [Frequently Asked Questions](/docs/faq.md) section for solutions.

**Contact Support**

Since modeling and simulation is is a domain that sometimes requires quite a bit of experience, we aim to provide the best support possible to all of our users.

Currently we offer support by options to contact our team via [email](mailto:support@osparc.io) or to open a support ticket from within the [platform](https://osparc.io) directly generating an issue in github, which will then flow into our backlog:

*accessible via your user settings, in the top right area of the platform*

Please note that github reporting requires a github account.

**Reporting of Issues** <br/>

Users can open a support ticket from within the platform directly generating an issue in github, which will then flow into our development backlog. For this, you need to have a [Github](https://github.com/) account.

**Provide Feedback**

Users can also directly leave feedback to us, e.g., via a google doc. This can be accessed via the "Give us feedback" button.
