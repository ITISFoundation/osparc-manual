## Submitting Code as oSPARC service

If you have a piece of code that you would like to make available to other *osparc* users, we would be happy to work with you to make this happen! To begin this process, you must first determine whether your code requires a custom GUI or real-time interaction to run (e.g. the [3D anatomical model viewer](/docs/isan_studies___tutorials/anatomical_viewer.md)  or  if it can run unsupervised after setting some initial conditions/parameters (e.g. [OpenCOR cardiac model](docs/isan_studies___tutorials/opencor.md). Currently, we have a far more streamlined onboarding procedure for purely computational services than interactive ones, but we would be happy to work with you to bring whatever you have to *osparc*! for purely computational services, please follow the steps outlined below.
