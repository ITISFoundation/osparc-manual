# What is *Sim4Life*

*Sim4Life* is a simulation platform co-developed by the [IT'IS Foundation](https://itis.swiss/news-events/news/latest-news/) and [ZMT Zurich MedTech AG](https://zmt.swiss), combining computable human phantoms with physics solvers and tissue models, for directly analyzing biological real-world phenomena and complex technical devices in a validated biological and anatomical environment. The *Sim4Life* platform also offers high performance with all the features expected from a multiphysics CAE/TCAD platform.

Together with the Virtual Population functionalized anatomical models, *Sim4Life* provides unique functionality for coupled EM-electrophysiological modeling and has been widely used to study low-frequency exposure safety (with and without implants), electroceuticals, neuroprosthetics, and brain- and spinal-cord- stimulation.

o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC, being developed de novo for running on the cloud in web-based environments will thus be partially based on key functionalities of *Sim4Life*, and extended. E,.g., two state-of-the-art simulation services will be interfaced: an EM solver, based on the quasi-static EM solvers from *Sim4Life*, to compute exposing field conditions from internal or external neurostimulation sources (e.g., electroceuticals, implants) at the anatomical and the micro-anatomical levels (nerve, fascicles, single axon exposure), and an electrophysiology solver based on *Sim4Life*'s T- NEURO module, which allows to simulate the impact of EM exposure on neuronal dynamics employing the open source tool NEURON.

### Components

The Core Functionality of *Sim4Life* is as follows:

**Computable Human Phantoms**

*Sim4Life* natively supports the Virtual Population ViP 3.x and 4.x models that include integrated posing and morphing tools. Other publicly available animal and human anatomical models are also supported. All tissues are linked to a continually updated physical properties database.

**Physics Solvers**

The *Sim4Life* solvers are specifically developed for computationally complex problems; HPC accelerated for the latest computer clusters; and smoothly integrated in the most advanced coupling framework. The platform already includes EM, Thermal Acoustic, and Flow solvers.

**Tissue Models**

The integrated tissue models enable the modeling and analysis of physiological processes. Perfusion models, tissue damage models, and neuronal models are included within Sim4Life.

**Framework**

The *Sim4Life* Framework efficiently facilitates all steps in complex multiphysics modeling, from defining the problem, discretizing, simulating, and analyzing to visualizing the results, with clarity and flexibility.
