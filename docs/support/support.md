# Help & Support

Getting started with modeling and simulation can be a challenging task. We will try our best to guide you along the way. In case our user manual and the tutorial examples could not answer your question, below you find information on how to get in touch with us.

## Contact Support and Submitting Feedback

You can find all the support-related links under the Help Center menu ("?" button.)

Currently we offer support in two ways:
* Contact our team via [email](mailto:support@osparc.io)  
* Open a support ticket from within the [platform](https://osparc.io) directly generating an issue in Github, which will then flow into our backlog.
Please note that Github reporting requires a [Github](https://github.com/) account.
* Provide Feedback with a form
