# Help & Support

Getting started with modeling and simulation can be a challenging task. We will try our best to guide you along the way. In case our user manual and the tutorial examples could not answer your question, take a look at the following resources:

## Contact Support and Submitting Feedback

Since modeling and simulation is a domain that sometimes requires quite a bit of experience, we aim to provide the best support possible to all of our users.
You can find all the support-related links under the Help Center menu ("?" button.)

Currently we offer support in two ways:
* Contact our team via [email](mailto:support@osparc.io)  
* Open a support ticket from within the [platform](https://osparc.io) directly generating an issue in Github, which will then flow into our backlog.
Please note that Github reporting requires a [Github](https://github.com/) account.
