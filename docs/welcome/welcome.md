# Background 
### About the SPARC Program
*o²S²PARC* is part of the NIH Common Fund’s [SPARC program](https://commonfund.nih.gov/Sparc/). The program focuses on increasing the understanding of peripheral nerves and how their electrical signals control internal organ function, with a view to advance neuromodulation therapies in order to make treatments more effective. It is structured as a consortium and consists of four components:

* SPARC 1: Anatomical and Functional Mapping of the Innervation of Major Internal Organs
* SPARC 2: Next Generation Tools and Technologies
* SPARC 3: Use of Existing Market-Approved Technology for New Market Indications
* SPARC 4: Data Resource Center (Data Coordination, Mapping, and Modeling)

The SPARC DRC serves as a central sharing hub for the research, engineering, and clinical communities, disseminating knowledge and tools to advance neuromodulation targeting organs or organ systems. It is composed of:

(i) Data Coordination Core (DAT-CORE, Dr. Joost Wagenaar Pennsieve, Inc., Philadelphia, USA): store, organize, manage, and track access to data and resources generated by SPARC

(ii) Map Synthesis Core (MAP-CORE, Prof. Peter Hunter, University of Auckland, New Zealand): build interactive modular, continually updated visualizations of nerve-organ anatomy and function

(iii) Modeling and Simulation Core (SIM-CORE (or *o²S²PARC*, Prof Niels Kuster, IT’IS Foundation, Switzerland): develop an online framework capable of hosting and connecting simulations to create predictive, multiscale, multiphysics models spanning from modulation sources acting at feasible access points to organ functional responses.

# What is o²S²PARC

o²S²PARC (also *osparc*) provides users with an interactive approach to effectively develop, extend, validate, certify, document, store, share, and apply models, explore the impact of stimulation parameters, and create predictive, multi-scale, multi-physics models for a wide range of scenarios.
One of the core elements of the platform is a set of novel neuro- and physiology-functionalized human and animal anatomical models (called NEUROCOUPLE and NEUROFAUNA, respectively). The models will allow simulation of in vivo fields generated by implanted or external stimulators, elucidation of the resulting neuromodulations, and assessment of the changes induced in organ physiology. A brief introduction to the platform's functionality and use can be found here:

The powerful and flexible simulation platform, developed according to open-source philosophy, will enable users to:

1. Connect existing and/or novel computational (in silico) models to perform studies
2. Easily integrate new structures (e.g., nerve microstructure) into the anatomical models
3. Generate new computational services, simulation studies, and anatomical models that can be shared with other users and researchers according to project-specific requirements.
