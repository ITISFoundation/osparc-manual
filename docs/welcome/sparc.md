# Background 
### About the SPARC Program
*o²S²PARC* is part of the NIH Common Fund’s [SPARC program](https://commonfund.nih.gov/Sparc/). The SPARC program enables the development of the next generation of neuromodulation devices informed by the systematic development of high-resolution anatomical and functional neural circuit maps of the peripheral nervous system.

The SPARC Data and Resource Center (DRC) is charged with creating a publicly available, multifunctional online hub facilitating coordination, synthesis, and prediction via four core functions: Data Coordination, Map Synthesis, Modeling and Simulation, and Knowledge Management. Funded investigators who are producing data, models, and tools closely coordinate with the DRC.

* **The SPARC Data Coordination Core (DAT-Core)**, formerly at Blackfynn, Inc., is now implemented by the [Pennsieve](https://app.pennsieve.io/) platform at the University of Pennsylvania. Pennsieve expands on the work done at Blackfynn to develop cloud-based solutions for data management and analysis for the neurosciences. As part of the SPARC OT award, the Pennsieve Team will develop functionality in their platform to support the SPARC data submission workflow. Investigators submit datasets for curation and publication to the SPARC Portal through the SPARC, or other dedicated consortium, workspace on the Pennsieve data management platform. The platform is developed with sustainability in mind assuring that the DAT-Core platform will continue to be viable beyond the funding horizon of the SPARC program, and the scope of the SPARC initiative. More information is available [here](https://docs.sparc.science/docs/dat-core).

* **The SPARC Knowledge Management Core (K-Core)** is a collaboration between the FAIR Data Informatics Lab at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and Whitby et al. headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana.

    K-Core functions as the curation and knowledge management hub for SPARC, working closely with the other cores on increasing the quality and FAIRness of SPARC datasets and building the SPARC Knowledge Graph and services. K-Core focuses on the following approaches to accomplish these goals:

    1. FAIR curation of all SPARC datasets through a set of curation tools and services developed and deployed by K-Core

    2. Providing SPARC with the infrastructure, tools, services, and information that creates an integrated environment for exploring data and knowledge. This work supports search and reasoning across the SPARC Knowledge Graph (image below) that holds the connectivity graph for CNS-PNS-end organ interactions linked to data produced within SPARC, as well as maps, models, simulations and other relevant information sources outside of SPARC.

    More information is available [here](https://docs.sparc.science/docs/k-core).

* **The SPARC Map Synthesis Core (MAP-Core)** is responsible for building interactive, modular, continually updated visualizations of nerve-organ anatomy and function. It is led by the Auckland Bioengineering Institute working with MBF Bioscience. More information is available [here](https://docs.sparc.science/docs/map-core).

* **The SPARC Modeling and Simulation Core (SIM-Core)** is implemented by the IT’IS Foundation, located in Zurich, Switzerland. It develops and maintains o²S²PARC, an interactive, online simulation platform that hosts SPARC computational models and solvers. It allows collaborative development and sharing, model coupling and cloud-based execution, data visualization and analysis, and ensures sustainability of the computational models developed within SPARC. o²S²PARC enables users to create predictive, multiscale, multi-physics models spanning from modulation sources acting on the peripheral nervous system (PNS) to the resulting modulation of organ functional response.
