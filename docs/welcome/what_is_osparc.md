# What is oSPARC

*osparc* will provide users with an interactive approach to effectively develop, extend, validate, certify, document, store, share, and apply models, explore the impact of stimulation parameters, and create predictive, multi-scale, multi-physics models for a wide range of scenarios.
One of the core elements of the platform is a set of novel neuro- and physiology-functionalized human and animal anatomical models (called NEUROCOUPLE and NEUROFAUNA, respectively). The models will allow simulation of in vivo fields generated by implanted or external stimulators, elucidation of the resulting neuromodulations, and assessment of the changes induced in organ physiology. A brief introduction to the platform's functionality and use can be found here:

The powerful and flexible simulation platform, developed according to open-source philosophy, will enable users to:

1. Connect existing and/or novel computational (in silico) models to perform studies
2. Easily integrate new structures (e.g., nerve microstructure) into the anatomical models
3. Generate new computational services, simulation studies, and anatomical models that can be shared with other users and researchers according to project-specific requirements.
