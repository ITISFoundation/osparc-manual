# ISAN - Good To Know

The IT'IS Foundation - as part of the DRC - is greatly pleased to welcome you to o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC, our online simulation platform for peripheral nerve system stimulation.

## Introduction

Being a central part of the NIH SPARC initiative, the SPARC Portal is a free, open-source platform that aims to catalyze development of next-generation bioelectronic medicines. The SPARC Portal provides a growing collection of autonomic neuroscience datasets, maps, and computational models ⁠— as well as the ability to interact with those resources all easy accessible within a web browser. Launched in July 2019 at ISAN, the Portal will ultimately enable users to run advanced analytics and multiscale simulations for predicting the effects of neuromodulation on organ function.

A first glimpse on the IT'IS o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC platform is provided at ISAN through the Portal. Provided examples range from data and anatomy visualization to the use of machine learning to predict compound action potentials, electrophysiological simulation of a small enteric network and of cardiac myocytes and tissue, and a multiscale model of cardiac control.

## Important Information

Please note that this is the first time ever for o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC to appear live to a broader audience.
The platform is still in its V0.0.10 beta state, thus providing limited functionality, moreover, we appreciate your patience and understanding for random glitches and issues.

Our support team is here to help with anything you need. Please feel free to [contact us](mailto:support@osparc.io) in case of questions or any required assistance.

We look forward to receiving your [feedback](mailto:support@osparc.io).

Enjoy o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC!

## Capabilities & Restrictions
For ISAN, the platform provides the following capabilities and restrictions.

### Provided Studies and Tutorials

The [SPARC Portal](http://dev-sparc-portal.sparc.science/) allows you to directly jump into one of the following studies and tutorial examples via the appropriate links:

* [UC Davis](/docs/isan_studies___tutorials/uc_davies.md)
* [2D Plot](/docs/isan_studies___tutorials/2d_plot.md)
* [Matt Ward](/docs/isan_studies___tutorials/matt_ward.md)
* [Anatomical Model Viewer](/docs/isan_studies___tutorials/anatomical_viewer.md)
* [OpenCor](/docs/isan_studies___tutorials/opencor.md)
* [Bornstein Viewer](/docs/isan_studies___tutorials/bornstein_view.md)
* [3D Results Viewer](/docs/isan_studies___tutorials/3D_view.md)

### Limitations

* **Anonymous User** <br/>
  
  The study links from the [SPARC Portal](http://dev-sparc-portal.sparc.science/) bring you directly into the study in the workbench - without going via the Dashboard.

  Doing so, you will be logged into the platform with an "Anonymous User" state, which allows you to operate within the study (change parameters, run simulations, view data, 3D models, results, etc.). However, this user state does not allow you to go far beyond the individual studies and explore all the features of the entire platform.

* **Limited Functionality**
  
  The "Anonymous User" is granted only limited access and capabilities of the platform  directly tailored to the needs for ISAN. Features like setting up new or modifying existing studies, operating in the Dashboard, using own Jupyter notebooks, etc. are not provided at this time.

## Beta User Program

If you got interested into o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC, all its capabilities and would like to apply for our *beta user program*, please send us an [email](mailto:support@osparc.io) or directly talk to one of our experts at the ISAN conference.
