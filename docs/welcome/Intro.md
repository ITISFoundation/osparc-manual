# Welcome

Welcome to the *o²S²PARC* Documentation. This user manual aims to provide detailed information and background about how to use the *o²S²PARC* modeling and simulation platform.

The SIM-CORE, is one of the four integrative cores of the [SPARC program’s Data Resource Center (DRC)](https://docs.sparc.science/docs/getting-started), funded by the NIH Common Fund’s [SPARC program](https://commonfund.nih.gov/Sparc/). The SPARC DRC closely collaborates on the development of the [SPARC Portal](https://sparc.science/), an open neuroscience and systems physiology platform containing multi-species data, knowledge, computational modeling and spatial mapping. 

SIM-Core is responsible for the computational modelling activities within the DRC and develops **o²S²PARC** (or *osparc* in short) – **O**pen **O**nline **S**imulations for **S**timulating **P**eripheral **A**ctivity to **R**elieve **C**onditions –  an open online framework, capable of establishing, hosting, connecting, executing, and sharing computational models and data analyses sustainably and reproducibly. The platform permits to create predictive, multiscale, multiphysics models spanning from modulation sources acting at feasible access points through to organ functional responses.

The aim of o²S²PARC is to establish a comprehensive, freely accessible, intuitive, and interactive online platform for simulating peripheral nerve system neuromodulation/ stimulation and its impact on organ physiology in a precise and predictive manner. To achieve this, the platform will comprise both state-of-the art and highly detailed animal and human anatomical models with realistic tissue property distributions that make it possible to perform simulations ranging from the molecular scale up to the complexity of the human body.
