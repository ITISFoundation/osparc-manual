# Background - About the SPARC Program

o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC is part of the NIH Common Fund’s [SPARC program](https://commonfund.nih.gov/Sparc/). The program focuses on increasing the understanding of peripheral nerves and how their electrical signals control internal organ function, with a view to advance neuromodulation therapies in order to make treatments more effective. It is structured as a consortium and consists of four components:

* SPARC 1: Anatomical and Functional Mapping of the Innervation of Major Internal Organs
* SPARC 2: Next Generation Tools and Technologies
* SPARC 3: Use of Existing Market-Approved Technology for New Market Indications
* SPARC 4: Data Resource Center (Data Coordination, Mapping, and Modeling)

The SPARC DRC serves as a central sharing hub for the research, engineering, and clinical communities, disseminating knowledge and tools to advance neuromodulation targeting organs or organ systems. It is composed of:
(i) Data Coordination Core (DAT-CORE, Dr. Joost Wagenaar Blackfynn, Inc., Philadelphia, USA): store, organize, manage, and track access to data and resources generated by SPARC
(ii) Map Synthesis Core (MAP-CORE, Prof. Peter Hunter, University of Auckland, New Zealand): build interactive modular, continually updated visualizations of nerve-organ anatomy and function
(iii) Modeling and Simulation Core (SIM-CORE (or o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC, Prof Niels Kuster, IT’IS Foundation, Switzerland): develop an online framework capable of hosting and connecting simulations to create predictive, multiscale, multiphysics models spanning from modulation sources acting at feasible access points to organ functional responses.
