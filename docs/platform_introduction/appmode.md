# App Mode

*o²S²PARC* provides another viewing option for a guided experience in exploring a **Study**. The idea behind the "App Mode" is to provide a way to step through the Services in a **Study** in a linear fashion, much like passing back and forth between slides of a slide presentation. This mode shows only the settings of Computational Services or the *Interactive View* of Interactive Services. To set up you Study for App Mode, you will first need to select which Services to display and in which order. Not all Services need to be displayed in App Mode. However, if certain Services must be run in order to access others (e.g. A Computational Service must run in order to create the data for a 2D Plot Service to plot), it will be run automatically during App Mode execution.2D

## App Mode Setup
1. Click on the empty space in your **Pipline Workspace** to see the **Study** information in the **Workbench** Secondary Column. Near the bottom, you will see "App Mode" - under this section, click the ```Edit``` button.

2. A window will pop up to show all services in the Study and several options to configure the App Mode. Use the eye-buttons to choose whether or not to show each Service in the App Mode and use the Up and Down arrows to rearrange the order in which Services Appear in App Mode. The Service marked with ```1``` will be the first Service shown in App Mode, the Service marked with ```2``` will be the second, and so on.

    When you are done editing, click ```Enable``` on the bottom right hand corner of the modal.

3. When you would like to enter App Mode, in the Secondary Column of the **Workbench**, click ```Start``` in the App Mode section.2D

4. To navigate through your Study in App Mode, you may click the left and right facing arrows in the "Slide Views". To go back to the default **Workbench** view, you may click ```Stop App``` on the top right hand corner.

**Note** If you go back to the **Dashboard** without stopping the App Mode (by clicking the **Dashboard** button on the top Menu of the **Workbench**), you will enter the **Study** in App Mode directly the next time you open the **Study**
