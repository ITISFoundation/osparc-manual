# Dashboard

The Dashboard is your private hub which contains all your simulation studies as well as studies that have been shared with you. From the Dashboard you are able to open your projects and studies in the o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC Workbench as well as create a new studies from scratch.

*Main sections and elements of the o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC Dashboard.*

The Dashboard is your personal landing page when you log into your o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC account. Within the Dashboard a number of important sections and elements can be distinguished and highlighted:

1. **Dashboard Button** <br/>
   This button allows you to return to the Dashboard and Overview at any time from anywhere within the platform.

2. **Dashboard Menu** <br/>
   The menu tabs give you quick access to a set of core elements of the platform, namely the Studies, the Services and the Data. 

3. **My Studies** <br/>
   In this section you'll find your personal (and private) studies which you have previously setup and which have been stored in the database. These are only accessible by you. Clicking (single click) on one of these studies will show more details, double clicking will get you into the study itself.<br/>
   
   Clicking on the (+) button allows you to setup a new study from scratch.

    *Setting up a fresh study via the "New Study" button.*

4. **Template Studies** <br/>
   Here you'll find a set of pre-defined studies which are templated for the user. The initial number of studies which has been primarily assembled for the ISAN conference portal roll out covers an interesting range of applications - working with 3D models, processing simulations, handling data and doing analysis/postrprocessing.

   Single or double clicking on one of the template studies will show more information or instantiate a new study by applying the chosen template. The new study will then be added to the "My Studies" section.

5. **Account Details** <br/>
    In the account details you'll find the preferences for your account as well as information about the software version and a link to this user manual document. In addition, you can logout from there.

*Account details for the current user which can be accessed by clicking on the user icon in the top right corner.*


6. **Reporting of Issues** <br/>
    Users can open a support ticket from within the platform directly generating an issue in github, which will then flow into our development backlog. For this, you need to have a [Github](https://github.com/) account.

    In addition, we are providing direct ways of leaving feedback from users, e.g., via a google doc. This can be accessed via the "Give us feedback" button.

    Which will then subsequently open an o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC Platform Feedback form.

Having outlined the different parts of the dashboard, we're now ready to look into the concept of the [Workbench](/docs/platform_introduction/core_elements/workbench.md).
