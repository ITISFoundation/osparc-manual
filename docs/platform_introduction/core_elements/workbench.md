# Workbench

The workbench is probably the most central place during your working sessions in o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC.

Within the workbench you can:

* setup new studies, e.g., within the flow chart
* access, maintain and extend existing studies
* do 3D solid modeling and work with meshes (e.g., high resolution anatomical models)
* run and observe your simulations
* view and analyze results (incl. 2D and 3D visualization)
* do general (post)processing of your data
* work with Jupyter notebooks
* and much more ...
