# Workbench

The workbench is probably the most central place during your working sessions in *osparc*.

Within the workbench you can:

* Set up new studies, e.g., within the flow chart
* Access, maintain and extend existing studies
* Perform 3D solid modeling and work with meshes (e.g., high resolution anatomical models)
* Run and observe your simulations
* View and analyze results (incl. 2D and 3D visualization)
* Perform general (post)processing of your data
* Work with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks
* and much more ...
