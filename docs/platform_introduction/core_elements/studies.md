# Studies

An actual modeling, simulation or data analysis project is called "Study". Any study is accessible via the dashboard either in the private (My Studies) or the templated (Template Studies) area, such as outlined in the previous [section](/docs/platform_introduction/core_elements/dashboard.md).

The content of a study can be manyfold, such as highlighted in the user manual, e.g., in the [Tutorials part](/docs/isan_studies___tutorials/uc_davies.md). In the tutorials (Template Studies) which are highlighted for ISAN, the users are provided with basic modeling, simulation and data processing examples of various kind.

However, eventually o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC will feature full 3D EM-neuro stimulation modeling of highest complexity using high-resolution anatomical model data.
