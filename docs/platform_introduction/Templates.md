# Templates

**Template Studies** refer to Studies that you may make copies of and reuse in your own work.

## Templates Tab
The **Templates** Tab of the **Dashboard** contains published Template Studies available to you.

 Clicking on a Template will create a copy of that Study, which will appear in your own **Studies** tab with the same name as the Template. Any changes you make to this copy will not affect the original Template. This is extremely useful, for example, if your team uses the same analysis pipeline but you may want to change an input file. 

Any changes you make to the resulting copy will not affect the Template which you have copied from. If you choose to create a Template from a Study you have created, it will also appear here in the **Templates** tab of the **Dashboard**.

### Grouping Templates
By default, the Templates will be displayed with a flat list. Alternatively, you can organize them by clicking on the Group button. For instance, you can group them by Tags that you have defined in your [User Profile](/docs/platform_introduction/profile.md) and that you used to [tag your templates](/docs/platform_introduction/user_setup/annotations.md#tags). Other grouping options are available, for instance "Shared with" will group them by [Organization](/docs/study_setup/sharestudy.md#organization).
