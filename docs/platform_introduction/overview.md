# Platform Overview

Welcome to *osparc*. This page gives a basic overview of how *osparc* works and how to navigate through the interface. We will highlight the most important parts and then go into more detail within subsequent sections. Within this overview section we'd like to get you familiar with the core elements and the basic philosophy of *osparc*. The core elements can be structured as follows:

* **Dashboard** <br/>
  The Dashboard is your private hub which contains all of your simulation studies as well as studies that have been shared with you. From the Dashboard you are able to open your projects and studies in the *osparc* Workbench or create a new study from scratch. More details about the Dashboard are provided in a dedicated [section](/docs/platform_introduction/core_elements/dashboard.md).

    *The *osparc* Dashboard. Here you'll find an overview of general elements, your account as well as all your simulation studies (private and shared).*

* **Workbench** <br/>
  The Workbench is the center of *osparc*. It is the central place for setting up, running, maintaining and analyzing your studies. More details about the workbench are provided [here](/docs/platform_introduction/core_elements/workbench.md).

    *The *osparc* Workbench. Here you can setup your service pipelines and studies, prepare models for simulation, specify simulation setups, visualize (post-process) your simulation results and much more.*

* **Studies** <br/>

    An actual modeling, simulation or data analysis project is called "Study". Any study is accessible via the dashboard either in the private (My Studies) or the templated (Template Studies) area. More information is shown [here](/docs/platform_introduction/core_elements/studies.md).

    *A study composed of several connected services within the workbench.*


* **Services** <br/>
  Every study in *osparc* is composed of at least one so-called service or, more commonly, several services.

  Service tyoes are or manyfold nature: they can provide data/files, can visualize results (2D, 3D), can be notebooks or can be computational services - doing the actual simulations within a study. More information is shown [here](/docs/platform_introduction/core_elements/services.md) and in this [section](/docs/platform_introduction/main_window_and_navigation/services/types.md).

  **osparc* provides a broad variety of services, e.g., 3D viewers which allow to render complex anatomical models.*

This just as a very brief overview of *osparc*. More details are provided now within the following sections.
