## My Studies

Under "My Studies" you'll find your personal (and private) studies which you have previously setup and which have been stored in the database. These are only accessible by you. Clicking (single click) on one of these studies will show more details, double clicking will get you into the study itself.<br/>
   
Clicking on the (+) button allow you to setup a new study from scratch.

## Template Studies

Under "Template Studies" you'll find a set of pre-defined studies which are templated for the user.

Single or double clicking on one of the template studies will show more information or initiate the generation of a new study by applying the chosen template. The new study will then be added to the "My Studies" section.
