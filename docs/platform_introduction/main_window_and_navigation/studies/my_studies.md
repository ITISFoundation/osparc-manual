# Studies

The first tab in the *osparc* Dashboard is dedicated to the studies overview - distinguishing between own studies and studies which have already been setup.

## My Studies

Under "My Studies" you'll find your personal (and private) studies which you have previously created and which have been stored in the database. These are only accessible by you. Clicking (single click) on one of these studies will show more details, double clicking will bring you into the study itself.<br/>

Clicking on the (+) button allow you to set up a new study from scratch.

## Template Studies

Under "Template Studies" you'll find a set of pre-defined studies which are templated for the user.

Single or double clicking on one of the template studies will show more information or initiate the generation of a new study that implements the chosen template. The new study will then be added to the "My Studies" section.
