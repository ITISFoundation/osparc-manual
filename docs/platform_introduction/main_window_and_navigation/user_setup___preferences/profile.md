# Profile

In the right top corner (clicking on the user icon/avatar), the user and platform preferences are available.

Clicking on the icon provides:

* the user preferences dialog
* a link to the user manual
* information about the current platform and versions of essential parts
* logout from the platform

## Preferences
Entering the preferences dialog, a separate window pops up which allows the user to define and modify settings and preferences as follows:

* __User Profile__ <br/>
  Information like name and profile picture can be set/changed.

* __Security Settings__ <br/>
  Here the user can change the password. Moreover (and quite important), in this dialog the user can specify access tokens for the DAT-Core/Blackfynn platform - for automated access of files (storage, retrieval) on Blackfynn. The [following section](/docs/platform_introduction/main_window_and_navigation/user_setup___preferences/security_details.md) will go into more detail about how to do this.

* __Additional (and Experimental) Settings__ <br/>
  Here, e.g., the UI Theme can be set (feature available in the future).
