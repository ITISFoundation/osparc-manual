# Security & DAT-Core Access

In this section and as an addition to the last section on user preferences, we'd like to particularly highlight how the user can specify access tokens for the DAT-Core/Blackfynn platform.

This will allow for automated access of files (storage, retrieval) by using the storage on Blackfynn. The appropriate drive will then be automatically mounted and accessible on the platform, e.g., in the File Picker wervice.

## Syncing with Blackfynn

The process to access your Blackfynn data is outlined in the animation below and consists of the following steps:

	1. Open the Preferences/Security Settings dialog in o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC.
	2. Go to [Blackfynn](https://app.blackfynn.io) and log yourself in.
	3. Go to your user preferences in Blackfynn (bottom left) and open the "View My Profile" dialog.
	4. Scroll down, click on "Create API Key" and provide a name for the key.
	5. Copy/paste both Key and Secret from Blackfynn into the appropriate fields in o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC.
	6. Click on "Add".
	7. That's it. Now you will be able to specify and copy files from and to Blackfynn directly in o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC.
