# Services & Types in the Tab

The second tab in the workbench holds various information about the different available services in the *osparc* platform.

Once you click on the tab, the resulting window will show you a list of all the currently  available services in this version of the platform. For some services there are different versions available for which individual information is provided.

*The Service Tab: listing up and filtering for all the different services available in the platform.*

The different services and types are outlined in detail within this [section](/docs/platform_introduction/service_catalog___types/service_types.md).

Filtering of services can be conveniently applied, such as explained [here](/docs/platform_introduction/main_window_and_navigation/filtering.md).
