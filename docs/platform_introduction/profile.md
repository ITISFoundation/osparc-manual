## Preferences
Entering the preferences dialog, a separate window pops up which allows the user to define and modify settings and preferences as follows:

* __Confirmation Settings__ <br/>
  Here, the User can toggle confirmation pop-ups throughout the platform, such as the confirmations when deleting a Study or a Service. We urge caution when disabling these alerts as we cannot retrieve deleted studies.

* __API Keys/Tokens__ <br/>
  Here the user can generate API key and secret pairs for use with the API (see [here](https://itisfoundation.github.io/osparc-simcore-clients/#/) for more API documentation). Users can also specify access tokens for the DAT-Core/Pennsieve platform - for automated access of files (storage, retrieval) on Pennsieve.

* __Create/Edit Tags__ <br/>
  Here you may define custom tags, or labels, for your Studies, that are only visible to you. See [here](/docs/platform_introduction/user_setup/annotations.md#tags) more information on how you can use them.
