# Flowchart

The flow chart is the format in which you can construct your studies. These are consisted of a series of nodes with which you can extract data, perform manipulations on those data and visualize them. Most nodes are services and can have inputs and outputs. If you are starting with a blank study, the working area will display “Double click this area to start” in friendly letters. Otherwise, it will show the current flowchart of the study with all nodes and connections.

Services that take input or provide output will be labeled as such. To connect compatible services, you can click on a service output and drag towards the appropriate input of the successive service. Alternatively, you may drag from the input of a service to the preceding service’s output.

To delete a connection, simply select the arrow connecting two nodes, a small unlink button will appear on the lower right hand corner of the flowchart workspace. Clicking this button will disconnect the two nodes.
