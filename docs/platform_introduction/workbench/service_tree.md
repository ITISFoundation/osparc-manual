# Service Tree

In this window, you can see the list of services that are included in the study. View or hide the services by clicking on the arrow next to the folder with the name of your study.  Double-clicking a service will create a new tab in the Dashboard menu or provide a pop-up window where you will be able to view and edit service parameters. To return to the flow chart view, simply close the pop-up or click on the name of your study in the Dashboard menu.
