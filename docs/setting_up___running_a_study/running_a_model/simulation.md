# Running a Simulation

For your custom models and basic computations, running a study is straightforward. Once you have your flowchart connected, first click __Retrieve__ at the bottom right hand corner of the workbench window. This will retrieve all the files referred to by the File Picker services and the Logger window will display any potential problems. 

After this is done, click the __Run__ button (next to the __Retrieve__ button).
