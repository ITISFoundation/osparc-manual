# Loading Data

So now that you know the basics of the o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC platform, you are ready to set up and run your own study.

To run a study with computational services, you will generally need to load your data. For now, this will only be done with the File Picker service. As demonstrated earlier, go ahead and enter into the settings of the File Picker to choose a file. Expanding __My Data__ you should be able to see the folder __simcore.s3__.

If you have synchronized o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC with another [data directory](/docs/platform_introduction\main_window_and_navigation\data\cloud_storage_types.md), you will also see it here. To choose a file, simply click on the name of the file in the o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC simcor directory or your synced directory. 

## Adding a Local File
You may also add a local file from your computer. To do this, select first the __simcore.s3__ folder and then click on __Add file(s)__. In the dialog popup, you may choose the file you would like to add. After the window refreshes, follow the directory tree:

open My Data -> simcore.s3 -> *name of your study* -> File Picker

Your file should now be listed here. Select it by double clicking and it should show up in the file name field of the File Picker service.
