# Loading Data

So now that you know the basics of the O2S2PARC platform, you are ready to set up and run your own study.

To run a study with computational services, you will generally need to load your data. For now, this will only be done with the File Picker service. As demonstrated earlier, go ahead and enter into the settings of the File Picker to choose a file. Expanding “My Data” you should be able to see the folder “simcor.” 

If you have synchronized OSPARC with another data directory, you will also see it here. To choose a file, simply click on the name of the file in the OSPARC simcor directory or your synced directory. 

You may also add a local file from your computer. To do this, select first the “simcor” folder and then click on “Add file(s)”. In the dialog popup, you may choose the file you would like to add.  After the window refreshes, open My Data -> simcore.s3 -> *name of your study* -> File Picker

Your file should now be listed here. Select it by double clicking and it should show up in the file name field of the File Picker service.
