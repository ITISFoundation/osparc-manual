# Submitting & Retrieving Files

Some services will provide you with output files. To access these files, double click on the service which supplies output. This will now show the Node files folder as well as the My Data folder. You may download these files locally. 

Other types of output include data visualizations, plots and renderings. These outputs all provide the option to download by their respective services. For example, the 2D plot service uses the RAW Graphs framework which allows you to download plotted data in multiple formats or HTML embedding.
