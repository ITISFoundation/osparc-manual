# Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks come in two flavors: Python and R.

You may upload your notebook into o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC and use it the same way as you would on the Jupyter platform. Here, you will need to take care to handle the inputs in the order that they are linked from preceding services or other data entry methods.

To load your code onto the o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC platform, add one of the jupyter services into your flowchart.

When you enter the settings menu of the service, you should be able to find a default notebook where you can begin scripting. You can also use the navigator to upload your own files.

A helpful information sheet can be seen at the top of each default notebook to give you an idea of how to access o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC inputs and retrieve outputs on the platform.
