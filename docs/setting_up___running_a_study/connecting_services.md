# Connecting Services

Once your data are uploaded, you can connect them to the appropriate services in the service catalog. Services that take input will often take multiple inputs. While each file picker gives data from a single file. Thus, it is important when connecting multiple File Pickers to the same service that the input settings are set appropriately 

Please see the [Flowchart section](/docs/platform_introduction/workbench/flowchart.md) for more details.
