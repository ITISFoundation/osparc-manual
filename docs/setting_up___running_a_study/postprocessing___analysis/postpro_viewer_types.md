# Postprocessing & Analysis

Now you have run your study - congratulations!

Finally you want to perform postprocessing on your generated data or make beautiful illustrations.

## Postpro Viewer Types
We currently have generic data viewers including 2D plots, 3D plots, and mesh modeling as well as viewers specific to the output of certain templates such as the Human and Rabbit cardiac models.

For generic viewing, you will mostly be using 2D and 3D plotting. Our 2D plotters use the open-source RAW Graphs framework which is a user-friendly and aesthetically appealing tool with various plot types you can explore.

It updates automatically with updates to selected options and so facilitates interactive exploration of data. It also keeps a history of all plot options so changing options is as easy as scrolling up in the plotter window while scrolling down will bring you to your most recent plot.

Our 3D plotters are based on the open-source ParaView application. For more details, see https://www.paraview.org/. For plotting rendering your own models, you input files through the File Picker in formats such as VTK. You may also build your own 3D models directly in the OSPARC platform.

These viewers will have an expansion option located on the right hand corner of the plotting window. This will allow you to more easily navigate through your visualization menu.
