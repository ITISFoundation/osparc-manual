To create the study from an existing template, navigate to the **Discover** tab of the dashboard and click on an existing card under the **Templates** section. This will create a copy of the template study which will from this point on, be accessible from the **Studies** tab of the Dashboard. This study will be private unless you decide to share it an any changes you make to the resulting study will not affect the template you have copied from.
