# Sharing and Publishing Studies

There are two ways in which your work on the online platform can be accessed by others. You may either share and instance of your study with other member(s) of Z43 or publish the study as a template for other members to copy. 

## Sharing a Study
Sharing a study instance with other users allows collaboration on the same pipeline and code. When one member of the shared users is editing a study, the study is locked for the others. When that user finishes and returns to their dashboard, the changes will be updated when another member accesses the study.

To share a study:
1. Access the study's options from the Dashboard by clicking on the three dot button on the upper right hand corner of the study's card. 
2. Choose the ```Permissions``` option
3. In the popup, click on the ```Members``` dropdown to see the list of users you may share with and then click the ```Add``` button.
4. The study will then appear in the **Studies** tab of the user(s) you have shared with. 

## Publishing a Study as a Template
Publishing a study as a template will save the state of the study at the current moment and it will appear as a *Template Study* in the **Discover** tab. Any changes made to the original study after publishing as a template will not change the template. Clicking on the template in the **Discover** tab will create a copy of the contents of the template accessible in your **Studies** tab. Any changes you make to this study will not affect the template. 

To publish your study as a template:
1. Access the study's options from the Dashboard by clicking on the three dot button on the upper right hand corner of the study's card. 
2. Choose the ```Publish as Template``` option.
3. The template will now appear as a **Template Study** in your **Discover** tab.
